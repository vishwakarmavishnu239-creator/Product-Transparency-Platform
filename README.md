Guiding Principles
My approach was guided by a few core principles across architecture, design, and product logic.

Architecture
The architecture is based on a decoupled, microservices approach. The frontend, backend, and AI components are separate services that can be developed and scaled independently. This makes the system more resilient and easier to maintain. For instance, you could update the AI's question-generation logic without needing to redeploy the main backend API.

Design
My primary design principle was "cognitive offloading," which means reducing the mental effort required from the user. I did this by:

Creating a multi-step form: This breaks down a complex process into simple, manageable steps, preventing the user from feeling overwhelmed.

Using clear, concise language: Each question is direct and easy to understand.

Providing a live report preview: This gives immediate feedback, so the user can see the final output as they work, which increases confidence and engagement.

Product Transparency Logic
The core logic for product transparency was built on three key pillars: health, wisdom, and virtue.

Health: The platform prioritizes questions related to a product's safety and potential health impacts, addressing consumer concerns directly.

Wisdom: By using dynamic, AI-powered questions, the platform gathers a comprehensive set of data, leading to a more complete and insightful report.

Virtue: The platform emphasizes clear, honest disclosure. It labels information that is unknown or unverified and creates a reproducible snapshot of the data, which builds trust with consumers.
